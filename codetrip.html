		method: method of sending collected data
			get: causes the information to be sent as a Query String included into the URL.

			post: HTTP Post request is ideally used when we wish to post content to the server. This is the more appropriate of the two methods for sending something like a password as the content is sent within Form Data and not directly visible in a query string in the URL as they are with GET requests.

			other HTTP methods: patch, put, delete
